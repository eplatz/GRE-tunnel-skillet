# GRE Tunnel Skillet 

The purpose of the GRE Tunnel Skillet is to provide a configuration template for performance testing with a GRE tunnel on Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls. 

The configuration includes changes to interfaces, zones, and a security policy rule with a security policy group in additon to the GRE tunnel configuration.

For testing with two Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls, skillet #1 should be loaded onto the first firewall and skillet #2 should be loaded onto the second firewall to complete both sides of the GRE tunnel.
